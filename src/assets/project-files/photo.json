        "description": "This week I explored the world of aperture. I experimented with both wide and narrow aperture and discovered that I prefer wide aperture. For these pictures, I woke up super early. Okay, I actually slept in a little, but it was still really cold outside. I was home for the weekend, visiting my family, so all of these pictures were taken in my parent’s backyard. I would go through and name all of my models, but my family has about 17 chickens and I don’t know all of their names. I was out taking pictures for just over an hour, only going in because my fingers were numb. I used Adobe Bridge and Photoshop to edit these pictures. I hope y’all like them!",

        "description": "This past weekend, we went on a trip to Island Park, ID. There, we took many different pictures. The ones below are more on the creative side. All of these pictures were taken at the same place, all on February 3rd, but all throughout the day. My personal favorites from these are the ones of the fishing equipment and the truck. These pictures were taken using a technique called Light Painting. I set the camera up on a tripod and set it to a long exposure, the turned off all of the lights. I then used a flashlight to paint the parts I wanted to have visible. It truly is a fun technique and it is hard to go wrong!",

The six images below are my personal favorites from this exploration.",

I finally narrowed it down to the five images below. I believe that these are my best photos for many reasons. One is that they are pretty. I asked my fiancé what he thought (he knows nothing about photography) and he thought that these ones looked good. I also think that they demonstrate all that I have learned this semester. These images required a lot of editing and they required knowledge about how to actually take the images. Some of these are product photography taken with a prime lens, others are portraits, some are from unique angles, and my favorite one is light painting. These are all skills that I did not have before this semester and I am glad I learned them. I hope you guys like these pictures!",
