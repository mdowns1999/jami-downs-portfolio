# Overview

I made this portfolio site for my wife, Jami Downs.  I tried showcasing here projects in a simple way.  She picked all the styles and layouts for the site.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code by Microsoft to program all my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I used the React framework to tie all these things together.  I also used GitHub Pages to host my web page.
